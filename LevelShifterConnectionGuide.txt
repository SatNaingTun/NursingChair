To connect an **Arduino** to a **Raspberry Pi** using a **level shifter**, you'll need to account for the voltage difference between the two devices. The **Arduino** typically operates at **5V logic**, while the **Raspberry Pi** uses **3.3V logic**, meaning direct connections could damage the Pi's GPIO pins.

### **Steps to Connect Using a Level Shifter**
1. **Choose a Level Shifter**  
   - A **bi-directional logic level converter** (e.g., **TXB0108** or **74AHCT125**) is ideal.
   - Ensure it supports **5V to 3.3V conversion**.

2. **Wire the Connections**  
   - **Power the Level Shifter**  
     - Connect **HV (High Voltage)** to **5V** from the Arduino.  
     - Connect **LV (Low Voltage)** to **3.3V** from the Raspberry Pi.  
     - Connect **GND** to both devices.

   - **Data Lines**  
     - Connect **Arduino TX** to **HV1** and **LV1** to **Raspberry Pi RX**.  
     - Connect **Raspberry Pi TX** to **LV2** and **HV2** to **Arduino RX**.

3. **Configure Serial Communication**  
   - Enable **UART** on the Raspberry Pi (`sudo raspi-config` â†’ Interface Options â†’ Serial).
   - Use `pyserial` or `minicom` on the Pi to communicate with the Arduino.
